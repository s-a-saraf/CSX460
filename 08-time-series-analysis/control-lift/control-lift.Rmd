Your job is to create a model for the control lift stability of a hypotetical 
aircraft. 

Download and the data at "~/data/control-lift.rds". Create a model for the 
control lift response as a function of alpha (angle of attach) and 
beta (roll angle) for the hypothetical aircraft.

```{r load_libs}
library(ggplot2)
library(psych)

library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)

```r
# Collect the data.
setwd("~/csx460/CSX460/08-time-series-analysis/control-lift/")
table <- readRDS("control-lift.rds")

# Explore the data.
summary(table)
str(table)
ggplot(data = table, aes(cl.stab)) + geom_histogram()

# Find NA's
table %>% sapply(. %>% is.na %>% sum)
library("Amelia")
missmap(table)

# Find the correaltion between the variables
pairs.panels(table[c( "cl.stab","alpha.deg", "beta.deg")])

# Make a naive model
fit.naive <- train(cl.stab ~ 1, table, method = "lm")

# Run caret -> lm for linear regression. This is the simple linear model.
library(caret)
fit <- train(cl.stab ~ ., table, method = 'lm')
fit
fit %>% summary()

# Get the formula used by caret lm
formula(fit)

# Plot a graph of cl.stab vs alpha.deg
table[ , qplot(table$alpha.deg, table$cl.stab) + geom_smooth()]

# We see that alpha is more imp feature and hence must be weighed in more.
# Change the model formula to use alpha ^ 3
# Observation : RMSE decreased

fit2 <- train(cl.stab ~ alpha.deg + I(alpha.deg ^ 2), table, method = 'lm')
fit2
fit2 %>% summary

# Try alpha cube, ^4, ^5 .... ^9
form.ho <- table$cl.stab ~ poly(alpha.deg, 9)
fit.ho <- train(form.ho, table$cl.stab, method = "lm")
yfit.ho$results #RMSE 

fit.ho$finalModel %>% summary
```

How good is your model?

What did you find surprising?
